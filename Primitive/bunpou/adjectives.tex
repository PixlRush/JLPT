Adjectives are the second major type of word that will be conjugated. Just like with verbs, it will be expanded on in Section \ref{sec:PR;文法;活用}.

Most adjectives will end in 〜い. There are other types of adjectives that will end with 〜な or 〜の, but those are things that have been turned into an adjective as opposed to more pure adjectives. Take the colour blue, you would write it as \ruby{青}{あお}い. You could also write it as \ruby{青}{あお}~but that would be grammatically a noun that is blue.

If we have the noun \ruby{英語}{えいご}, we can say something is English - `The `th' sound is an English sound.' - by attaching a 〜な to it. See the translation as follows: 『「ｔｈ」　は　えいご　な　の　おと　です。』. Translating this literally we get: `As for `th', English language's sound is.' Which when translated more for meaning will get you the original sentence above.
